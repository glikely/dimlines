# dimlines

This project holds a module created to solve an issue related to using OpenSCAD.

While most users appear to be using OpenSCAD to generate models that will
ultimately find expression in 3D printing, I use it to design parts that I
would make from use of my lathe and other metalworking tools. I wanted to
design the part, print a dimensioned drawing, and walk out to my shop to make
the part. However, it was surprisingly difficult. Being able to generate
dimensioned drawings proved to be problematical. This project grew out of that
motivation.

This code can be used to create dimensioned lines, title blocks etc. used to
document parts.
